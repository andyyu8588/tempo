    "Instructions": "Bench press is a great exercise for building a powerful chest.\n\nThe bench press is one of the power exercises, known to be very effective for building body mass. Learning how to do a proper bench press is well worth the effort.\n\n\nSteps : \n\n1.) Lie with your back flat on a bench with your feet firmly on the ground and the bar resting on the bench’s rack.\n\n2.) Slowly lift the bar off the rack and hold it above your chest as this will be the starting position.\n\n3.) Then lower the bar down until it is slightly above your chest, making sure that it doesn't touch or slam against your chest.\n\n4.) Hold this position briefly and make sure you have complete control of the bar, then raise it back up to the starting postion.\n\n3.) Place the bar on the rack and that will complete your set.\n\nTips :\n\n1.) By changing the width of the grip on the bar will change the focus and targeting of the exercise. Using a medium grip is the most common grip on the bar which is slightly wider than shoulder-width that is typically marked on the bar.\n\n2.) Using a spotter while performing this exercise is essential to make sure that the bar doesn't drop onto your chest and a spotter can provide motivation to lift more weight.\n\n3.) The most important thing about the bench press exercise is using a weight that you can manage while maintaining proper form. Many individuals try to lift more weight than they can manage which results in injuring and incorrectly performing the exercise."

    "Instructions": "The barbell squat is used for building muscle mass, strengthening up the quads and is one of the main power exercises.\n\nSteps :\n\n1.) To begin this exercise, set up a bar with the amount of weight that you would like to perform on a squat rack.\n\n2.) Lift the bar off of the rack and position the weight so that it is rested upon your traps.\n\n3.) Keeping your head upward and looking forward, slightly bend at your knees and push back your hips then lower your body slowly to the floor.\n\n4.) Slowly lower your body until your quads are parallel to the ground then hold for a count feeling a stretch in your muscles.\n\n5.) Return back up to the starting position and repeat for as many reps and sets as desired.\n\nTips :\n\n1.) We recommend using a squat rack to help you when performing this exercise unless you are going to perform the squat with a very low weight.\n\n2.) By keeping your head looking forward and slightly upward, it will help you prevent from arching your back.\n\n3.) Tightening your abs will help take any pressure off of your back.\n\n3.) Before you start using a heavy weight, make sure your back is strong enough to handle the pressure. Perform dead lifts and supermans.\n\n4.) It is important to make sure that you are strong enough and your back is able to handle enough pressure from the weight rested upon your body.\n\n5.) Perform deadlifts and superman exercises to help strengthen your body for this exercise.\n\n6.) If you feel any pain or discomfort when performing the squat exercise, stop doing them immediately to prevent any further injury.\n\n7.) Remember to breathe and prevent from locking your knees as you could possibly pass out from blood rush."

    "Instructions": "Similar to the cable crossover, the flat bench cable fly targets your chest using the fly motion but the difference with this exercise is that it allows you to lay flat on a bench and support your back.\n\nSteps : \n\n1.) Start off by placing a bench in between 2 cable machines and making sure that the bench is position so that when you lie down on it, your shoulders are in line with the pulleys.\n\n2.) Then grab a handle in each hand and sit on the edge of the bench, then slowly lean back until you are fully rested upon the bench and in the starting position.\n\n3.) Keep your arms out to your sides with your elbows pointed down at the ground with a slight bend.\n\n4.) Slowly lift the handles up above your chest to perform this exercise, squeezing your chest muscles and holding for a count.\n\n5.) Return back to the starting position and repeat for as many reps and sets as desired.\n\nTips : \n\n1.) It is important to perform this exercise on a weight that you are able to manage to prevent any injuries."
